cmake-practice-source-code
==========================

Source code for cmake-practice.pdf

This source code is written by me when I read this pdf: http://sewm.pku.edu.cn/src/paradise/reference/CMake%20Practice.pdf

I also committed one copy of the pdf in this repo, so please feel free to download it and refer to the source code.

At last, I want to give a bit thanks to the autor of this pdf. THANK YOU, CJacker.
